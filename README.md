This method is simpler than image processing, by using the GM 65 module to read data from barcodes. The GM 65 module communicates with the PIC 16f877A microcontroller via UART standard and sends barcode data in the form of character strings. The PIC 16f877A will receive and process the character string to classify products into different groups.
